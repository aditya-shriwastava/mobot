# What is Mobot?

If you are looking for a mobile robot to experiment with then you will notice:
- Good ones are very expensive,
- and affordable ones are incapable of doing anything.

Mobot is a mobile robot that leverages the capabilities of mobile phone (i.e. Cameras, IMU, Speaker, Microphone, Flashlight, Battery, Touchscreen, WiFi, LTE Modem, CPU, & GPUs) which makes it very capable but yet inexpensive.

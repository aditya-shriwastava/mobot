## What is Mobot?
Currently robots are either expensive or make significant compromises on it capabilities.

Mobot is mobile robot that leverages capabilities of mobile phone and laptop which makes it very capable but yet inexpensive.
1. **Mobile Phone:** For it rich sensor suites (i.e. camera, accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer, etc…) and state-of-the-art communication capabilities (i.e. WiFi, Bluetooth, etc…).
2. **Laptop:** For its powerful computational abilities and extensive language (i.e. python, c/c++) and software (i.e. ROS, OpenCV, PyTorch etc) support.

## To get started
1. Get a chassis for mobot (DIY).
2. Install Mobot app on your mobile phone from playstore (Or build from source).
3. Install Mobot python package on your laptop from PyPI (or build from source).
4. Now you are good to go (see Tutorial to start programming your mobot).
